Learning to setup the gateway, ip address & connection various physical devices like Pc, Hub and Switch.

Observations:

->Simulation is started by placing a simple PDU in source (PC0) and destination devices (PC3).

->At first stage we can see that message packet is transfered from PC0 to HUB.

->At second stage HUB being a dumb deivce transfered the packet to connected device. i.e ( to PC2 and Switch0).

->At third stage packet at PC2 is de-encapuslated and dropped as it was not the destination point 
  and unlink HUB Switch is a smart device it reads the packet destionation address and transmits to the correct device.
  So Switch0 transfers packet only to PC3 not to PC1 as it knows the destination.

->At fourth stage the PC3 de-encapuslate and accepts the packet and an acnknowledgement is sent by encapsulating it back to Switch0 with destination address of PC0.

->Switch0 transmits the ack packet to HUB.

->Again HUB transfer the packet to all device connected. i.e (PC0 and PC2).

->The Packet at PC2 is de-encapsulated and drop as it is not the correct destination.

->The ack packet is de-encapsulated and then accepted by PC0.
